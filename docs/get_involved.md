# Get Involved

Contributing to iFood projects is not only about code. There are may ways to help a project to grow, and we list below some ideas:

- Using a project. Go through the Getting started guide, and if you look somenthing wrong, let us know by [opening an issue](#reporting-new-issues).
- Look through the project open issues. Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels. Help [triage issues](#triaging-issues-and-pull-requests).
- If you find an issue you would like to fix, [open a pull request](/docs/development#pull-requests).
- Read through the project docs. If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can open a issue or a pull request with a change suggestion.
- Take a look at the features requested by others in the community and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

## [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ifood/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

iFood has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](https://github.com/ifood/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Triaging Issues and Pull Requests

One great way you can contribute to the project without writing any code is to help triage issues and pull requests as they come in.

- Ask for more information if you believe the issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.
- Suggest labels that can help categorize issues.
- Flag issues that are stale or that should be closed.
- Ask for test plans and review code.
